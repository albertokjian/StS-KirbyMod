# Kirby StS Design With Basic Powers

## Archetype Ideas

### Friendly Minions:

Start with Bandana Waddle Dee that forces the enemy to attack him instead. 

A friend can only be replaced by another friend. (either summoned from kirby’s ability or a card that summons the friend).

At the end of each combat, the friend and ability is preserved for the next combat (relic).

Every time you would lose HP, your friends would split the HP damage up to their HP.

Every time you absorb a friend, perform the friend’s action (on you if on self, on enemy if on enemy) immediately, and gain a friendly power.

Allow 1 single friend at a time that alternates damage between you and it.

### Friends / Sleep / Eat

Can summon up to two friendly minions (from defeated enemies or friends) 

### Wall Building

Other than guarding (blocks), Kirby creates defensive walls (just the same as barricade)

### Inhale

This turn, gain a 0-cost monster card from absorbed monster. At the end of the combat, player can get rewarded with the monster card. Cannot inhale monsters with block.

### Make Friends

Convert the enemy to friendly minion that will persist through fights.

### Kirby Powers

While you are in a kirby power, your other kirby power card become 0-cost card that has effect of draw one card.

### Custom Bosses that targets Kirbys abilities

### Next X turns your attack/block will have extra abilities

### Basic Attacks like Dash/Sword/Air/Simple

### Proficiency for power cards

### Complete overhaul with enemies

### Campsite has 1 free action per turn for converting a card to a kirby card

## Weird Ideas

- Thieves ability will give you fake gold, this opens a shop right before the Act3 boss fight
- Absorbing slime boss / large slime allows you to split into two kirbys, each capable of having new abilities and share the same cards
